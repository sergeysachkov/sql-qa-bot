Creating a New Table
You can create a new table by specifying the table name, along with all column names and their types:
CREATE TABLE weather (
    city            varchar(80),
    temp_lo         int,           -- low temperature
    temp_hi         int,           -- high temperature
    prcp            real,          -- precipitation
    date            date
);
You can enter this into psql with the line breaks. psql will recognize that the command is not terminated until the semicolon.
