Deletions
Rows can be removed from a table using the DELETE command. Suppose you are no longer interested in the weather of Hayward. Then you can do the following to delete those rows from the table:
DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';
All weather records belonging to Hayward are removed.
SELECT * FROM weather;
